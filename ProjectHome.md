This is a bash script that will install devkitPPC, libogc, libfat-ogc, as well as the Wii and GameCube examples.  It will also create symbolic links so that you can run any program included straight from the Terminal.  To run it, you must use sudo.  You may check out the script - you can tell there is nothing malicious about it.

To run, use the following command in a terminal window while in the directory containing the .sh scripts:

sudo sh devkitPPC.sh

To uninstall while you are in the directory with the scripts, run:

sudo sh devkitPPC-uninstall.sh
